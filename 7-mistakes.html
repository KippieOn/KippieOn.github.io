            <h1 >The 7 deadliest mistakes insurance companies make today that might jeopardize their profitability (or even take them out of business) on the next 5-10 years</h1>

            <h4 class="text-justify subtitle-style">Introduction</h4>

            <p class="text-justify">Insurance has remained a dormant area for quite some time. Almost every other industry has become deeply transformed by technology during the last 10-20 years. In all these areas, we have seen major disruption. Lots of innovation from small start-ups.</p>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">Most of them have failed miserably, to innovate and to market themselves. They executed poorly. But some of them made it.</p>
						<p class="text-justify main-style">Some of them "disrupted" the way we did business in that industry, the products, the offers, the marketing. And now those industries, would not be easily recognizable by our grandparents.</p>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">Because the changes have been so profound...nothing remained the same.</p>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">Right now, we're seeing a major transformation in finance. With the raising of Fintech with companies like Transferwise and Monzo in the UK. Bank APIs are becoming ubiquitous and everyone can access bank information easily and fast.</p>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">We have even seen the rise of decentralized currencies. They even have their very own "Market Exchange" where they are being traded daily. Basically, a FOREX for digital currencies.</p>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">That hasn't happened to insurance...yet.</p>

						<h4 class="text-justify subtitle-style">Trend</h4>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">But now, entrepreneurs from every breed have turned their eyes into this untapped industry. Into this virgin terrain. And boy, are we going to see a change in insurance...</p>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">We can see it already in the US. There are early indicators of this. Just look at Lemonade. They are getting flooded with waves of new customers.</p>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">Big insurers dismissed Cover because they were insuring everyday life objects. Now, the guys from Cover are turning their eyes into bigger and better stakes. And since their customer base are happy with them...guess who is going to lose big time?</p>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">These are just a couple examples of startups. What is important to take away is what they are doing is to set the new standards of how clients are treated and want to be treated, what they get out of their money, and how their money is going to be spent.  </p>

						<p class="text-justify main-style">With this trend and so many new startups getting funded and into the scene, here is a list of 7 potential threats facing well and long established insurance companies.</p>


						<h4 class="text-justify subtitle-style">The meat</h4>
						<!-- <p class="text-justify main-style">We have divided the threads between internal and external. External threads are more difficult to control. Internal threads are easily attainable because they are linked directly to your actions. So, the first 1-5 are external and from the 6th onwards are internal threads. </p> -->

						<ul>
							<li>1. Dismissing companies because they are small. </li>
							<p class="text-justify main-style"> Being small, if you succeed is just temporary. Small companies can pivot and change their product and the value they bring to the table very fast.</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style"> Just look at companies like Cover or others alike. What they do when they start might not seem impressive/important to you and your market share...but on the long run, and this is all about the long the run, they might change their focus and thanks to their momentum and buzz, affect your market share.</p>


							<li>2. Don't diversify your products.</li>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">Some of this ideas might not seem serious to you, but having them on the pipeline of projects and ready to go live will save you lots of money and time in the future.</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">Just have a small team creating the policies or whatever is required to do wrist-watch insurance (or cat? insurance if that exists).</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">You can try if that works for your clients as well. You might not move that fast as the little startup, but you certainly have a bigger client base to offer your services to. (And to test if this works and generates revenue or is just a failed attempt.)</p>


							<li>3. Be open to partnerships early on.</li>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">This is a win-win agreement for both sides, even if it doesn't look like. When these startups are young, they need lots of effort, money, partnerships, and press. </p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">Founders are looking around all the time for great partnerships, and while they are young they might accept terms you would otherwise not get when they are bigger. And sometimes, when they are bigger, they don't want partnerships, or you must agree to their terms.</p>


							<li>4. Playing the big company role. </li>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">This means getting in touch and going forward with a partnership, deal or whatever involving a second party, and then pulling back your offerings. And then not getting in touch again for some months, and go after them some months later.</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">You can afford to do it,  in the short term. It's easy for a well-established company to take its time to get to a decision. Or even to wait for months. Or to change their mind.</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">But the new blood coming to play, are not in the mood to wait. And if your deals don't go through, and you pull back, you might not be in a position to do so in the not so distant future.</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">Because it is an integrity game and some of the things big companies do, are usually perceived as sneaky for smaller companies. And that can hurt badly their reputation. Even if they don't realize this can happen, it does.</p>


							<li>5. Playing the well-established company trick</li>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">"We have been around for 50 years" - that means nothing. There was a point in time this was very important. Especially when you were facing the public. </p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">Now? Saying you've been around for 50 years, make you look...antiquate. You are perceived as a dormant giant. You might have done well and maybe your offers are good but... this new company have so much energy and their offers are so good and they pay so much attention to their clients and to detail...</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">Clients will think you're good and then join the new one.</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">And when facing young companies... it also means nothing. They are disconnected from the establishment. And see the establishment as lack of innovation. </p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">Also, when you think, "we have been in business for 50 years," that makes the whole company think nothing or no one is going to kick you off. </p>


							<li>6. Not acquiring competition early.</li>
							<p class="text-justify main-style"> It's also a mistake to acquire competition too early. Both are really bad. There is a sweet spot which lays between the value provided (and perceived by their clients) and the number of customers in their database divided by the churn rate (people changing companies).</p>


							<li>7. Starting and holding bad relationships with clients.</li>
							<p class="text-justify main-style"> This is so frequent I can't believe someone hasn't done anything before to address every aspect of it.</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">One of the best intents though comes from AXA. They have been investing lots and lots of money into rebuilding their brand from the ground up and become a more vital and company.</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style">They still have a long way until you find the same relationships you can find in the consumer market where clients have every other right and everything is easy, fast and painless.</p>
							<p class="text-justify main-style"> Better customer relationships is a two way street. You need to have somehow a two side communication between the company and the client. And that is the first point we address as a company. Because we know it might be hard to do that when you're focused on other areas.</p>
						</ul>

						<h4 class="text-justify subtitle-style"> Closing</h4>
						<p  class="text-justify main-style">While we don't know certainly what is going to happen and which startups are going to make it, which insurance companies are going to remain and which ones are going to go for the better, we certainly know this change has already started and it's going to stay.</p>


						<h4 class="text-justify subtitle-style">Reminder</h4>
						<p class="text-justify oblique last">Just remember, once we all searched with Altavista and when Google came out with their PageRank algorithm people dismissed them because Search was already figured out. But time has demonstrated </p>
